Use the Storybook CLI to install it in a single command. Run this inside your project‚Äôs root directory:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="create-command.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

<details id="custom-storybook-version">
  <summary>Install a specific version</summary>

  For installing Storybook 8.3 or newer, you can use the `create` command with a specific version:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="create-command-custom-version.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  To install a Storybook version prior to 8.3, you must use the `init` command:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="init-command-custom-version.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  For either command, you can specify either an npm tag such as `latest` or `next`, or a (partial) version number. For example:

  * `storybook@latest init` will initialize the latest version
  * `storybook@7.6.10 init` will initialize `7.6.10`
  * `storybook@7 init` will initialize the newest `7.x.x` version

  
</details>

Storybook will look into your project's dependencies during its install process and provide you with the best configuration available.

The command above will make the following changes to your local environment:

* üì¶ Install the required dependencies.
* üõ† Setup the necessary scripts to run and build Storybook.
* üõ† Add the default Storybook configuration.
* üìù Add some boilerplate stories to get you started.
* üì° Set up telemetry to help us improve Storybook. Read more about it [here](../configure/telemetry.mdx).

  ## Run the Setup Wizard

  If all goes well, you should see a setup wizard that will help you get started with Storybook introducing you to the main concepts and features, including how the UI is organized, how to write your first story, and how to test your components' response to various inputs utilizing [controls](../essentials/controls.mdx).

  ![Storybook onboarding](../_assets/get-started/example-onboarding-wizard.png)

  If you skipped the wizard, you can always run it again by adding the `?path=/onboarding` query parameter to the URL of your Storybook instance, provided that the example stories are still available.
</IfRenderer>

## Start Storybook

Storybook comes with a built-in development server featuring everything you need for project development. Depending on your system configuration, running the `storybook` command will start the local development server, output the address for you, and automatically open the address in a new browser tab where a welcome screen greets you.

  #### Run Storybook with other package managers

  The Storybook CLI includes support for the industry's popular package managers (e.g., [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)) automatically detecting the one you are using when you initialize Storybook. However, if you want to use a specific package manager as the default, add the `--package-manager` flag to the installation command. For example:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="create-command-custom-package-manager.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  #### The CLI doesn't detect my framework

  If you're working with a custom environment setup or need to set up Storybook manually, you can use the `--type` flag to specify the framework you need to use. Listed below are the supported frameworks and examples of how to use them:

  | Framework      | Type             |
  | -------------- | ---------------- |
  | Angular        | `angular`        |
  | Ember          | `ember`          |
  | HTML           | `html`           |
  | Next.js        | `nextjs`         |
  | Preact         | `preact`         |
  | Qwik           | `qwik`           |
  | React          | `react`          |
  | Server         | `server`         |
  | Solid          | `solid`          |
  | Svelte         | `svelte`         |
  | Vue 3          | `vue3`           |
  | Web Components | `web_components` |

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="create-command-manual-framework.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  #### Yarn Plug'n'Play (PnP) support with Storybook

  If you've enabled Storybook in a project running on a new version of Yarn with [Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) (PnP) enabled, you may notice that it will generate `node_modules` with some additional files and folders. This is a known constraint as Storybook relies on some directories (e.g., `.cache`) to store cache files and other data to improve performance and faster builds. You can safely ignore these files and folders, adjusting your `.gitignore` file to exclude them from the version control you're using.

  #### Run Storybook with Webpack 4

  If you previously installed Storybook in a project that uses Webpack 4, it will no longer work. This is because Storybook now uses Webpack 5 by default. To solve this issue, we recommend you upgrade your project to Webpack 5 and then run the following command to migrate your project to the latest version of Storybook:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="storybook-automigrate.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  <If notRenderer="angular">

    #### Storybook doesn't work with an empty directory

    By default, Storybook is configured to detect whether you're initializing it on an empty directory or an existing project. However, if you attempt to initialize Storybook, select a Vite-based framework (e.g., [React](./frameworks/react-vite.mdx)) in a directory that only contains a `package.json` file, you may run into issues with [Yarn Modern](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started). This is due to how Yarn handles peer dependencies and how Storybook is set up to work with Vite-based frameworks, as it requires the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) package to be installed. To solve this issue, you must install Vite manually and initialize Storybook.

  </If>

  <IfRenderer renderer="angular">
    #### Storybook doesn't work with my Angular project using the Angular CLI

    Out of the box, adding Storybook to an Angular project using the Angular CLI requires you to run the installation command from the root of the project or, if you're working with a monorepo environment, from the directory where the Angular configuration file (i.e., `angular.json`) is located as it will be used to set up the builder configuration necessary to run Storybook. However, if you need, you can extend the builder configuration to customize Storybook's behavior. To learn more about the available options, see the [Angular framework documentation](./frameworks/angular.mdx#how-do-i-configure-angulars-builder-for-storybook).
  </IfRenderer>

  <IfRenderer renderer="ember">
    #### The CLI doesn't support my Ember version

    The Ember framework relies on an auxiliary package named [`@storybook/ember-cli-storybook`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/ember-cli-storybook) to help you set up Storybook in your project. During the installation process you might run into the following warning message in your terminal:

    ```shell
    The ember generate entity-name command requires an entity name to be specified.
    For more details, use ember help.
    ```

    It may be the case that you're using an outdated version of the package and you need to update it to the latest version to solve this issue.
  </IfRenderer>

  <IfRenderer renderer="vue">
    #### Storybook doesn't work with my Vue 2 project

    Vue 2 entered [End of Life](https://v2.vuejs.org/lts/) (EOL) on December 31st, 2023, and is no longer maintained by the Vue team. As a result, Storybook no longer supports Vue 2. We recommend you upgrade your project to Vue 3, which Storybook fully supports. If that's not an option, you can still use Storybook with Vue 2 by installing the latest version of Storybook 7 with the following command:

    {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

    <CodeSnippets path="storybook-init-v7.md" />

    {/* prettier-ignore-end */}
  </IfRenderer>

  <IfRenderer renderer="svelte">
    #### Writing native Svelte stories

    Storybook provides a Svelte [addon](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-svelte-csf) maintained by the community, enabling you to write stories for your Svelte components using the template syntax. Starting with Storybook 8.2, the addon is automatically installed and configured when you initialize your project with the Svelte framework. However, if you installed a [specific version](#custom-storybook-version) of Storybook, you'll need to take additional steps to enable this feature.

    Run the following command to install the addon.

    {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

    <CodeSnippets path="svelte-csf-addon-install.md" />

    {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

    <Callout variant="info">

      The CLI's [`add`](../api/cli-options.mdx#add) command automates the addon's installation and setup. To install it manually, see our [documentation](../addons/install-addons.mdx#manual-installation) on how to install addons.

    </Callout>

    Update your Storybook configuration file (i.e., `.storybook/main.js|ts`) to enable support for this format.

    {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

    <CodeSnippets path="main-config-svelte-csf-register.md" />

    {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

    <Callout variant="info" style={{ marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
      The community actively maintains the Svelte CSF addon but still lacks some features currently available in the official Storybook Svelte framework support. For more information, see the [addon's documentation](https://github.com/storybookjs/addon-svelte-csf).
