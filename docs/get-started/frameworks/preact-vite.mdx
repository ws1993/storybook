Storybook for Preact & Vite is a [framework](../../contribute/framework.mdx) that makes it easy to develop and test UI components in isolation for [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) applications built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It includes:

* 🏎️ Pre-bundled for performance
* 🪄 Zero config
* 💫 and more!

<If notRenderer="preact">
  <Callout variant="info">
    Storybook for Preact & Vite is only supported in [Preact](?renderer=preact) projects.
  </Callout>

  {/* End non-supported renderers */}
</If>

<If renderer="preact">
  ## Requirements

  * Preact 8.x || 10.x
  * Vite ≥ 4.0
  * Storybook ≥ 8.0

  ## Getting started

  ### In a project without Storybook

  Follow the prompts after running this command in your Preact project's root directory:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="init-command.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  [More on getting started with Storybook.](../install.mdx)

  ### In a project with Storybook

  This framework is designed to work with Storybook 7+. If you’re not already using v7, upgrade with this command:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="storybook-upgrade.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  #### Automatic migration

  When running the `upgrade` command above, you should get a prompt asking you to migrate to `@storybook/preact-vite`, which should handle everything for you. In case that auto-migration does not work for your project, refer to the manual migration below.

  #### Manual migration

  First, install the framework:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="preact-vite-install.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  Then, update your `.storybook/main.js|ts` to change the framework property:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="preact-vite-add-framework.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  ## API

  ### Options

  You can pass an options object for additional configuration if needed:

  {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

  <CodeSnippets path="preact-vite-framework-options.md" />

  {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  #### `builder`

  Type: `Record<string, any>`

  Configure options for the [framework's builder](../../api/main-config/main-config-framework.mdx#optionsbuilder). For this framework, available options can be found in the [Vite builder docs](../../builders/vite.mdx).
