Storybook for Web components & Vite is a [framework](../../contribute/framework.mdx) that makes it easy to develop and test UI components in isolation for applications using [Web components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Requirements

* Vite ≥ 4.0
* Storybook ≥ 8.0

## Getting started

### In a project without Storybook

Follow the prompts after running this command in your Web components project's root directory:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="create-command.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

[More on getting started with Storybook.](../install.mdx)

### In a project with Storybook

This framework is designed to work with Storybook 7+. If you’re not already using v7, upgrade with this command:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="storybook-upgrade.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

#### Automatic migration

When running the `upgrade` command above, you should get a prompt asking you to migrate to `@storybook/web-components-vite`, which should handle everything for you. In case that auto-migration does not work for your project, refer to the manual migration below.

#### Manual migration

First, install the framework:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="web-components-vite-install.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Then, update your `.storybook/main.js|ts` to change the framework property:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="web-components-vite-add-framework.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

## API

### Options

You can pass an options object for additional configuration if needed:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="web-components-vite-framework-options.md" />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

The available options are:

#### `builder`

Type: `Record<string, any>`

Configure options for the [framework's builder](../../api/main-config/main-config-framework.mdx#optionsbuilder). For this framework, available options can be found in the [Vite builder docs](../../builders/vite.mdx).
