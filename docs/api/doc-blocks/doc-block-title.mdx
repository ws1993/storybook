<YouTubeCallout id="uAA1JvLcl-w" title="Avoid Documentation Nightmares with Storybook's Title Doc Block" params="start=57" />

The `Title` block serves as the primary heading for your docs entry. It is typically used to provide the component or page name.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

```md title="ButtonDocs.mdx"
import { Title } from '@storybook/blocks';

<Title>This is the title</Title>
```

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

## Title

```js
import { Title } from '@storybook/blocks';
```

`Title` is configured with the following props:

### `children`

Type: `JSX.Element | string`

Provides the content. Falls back to value of `title` in an [attached](./doc-block-meta.mdx#attached-vs-unattached) CSF file (or value derived from [autotitle](../../configure/user-interface/sidebar-and-urls.mdx#csf-30-auto-titles)), trimmed to the last segment. For example, if the title value is `'path/to/components/Button'`, the default content is `'Button'`.

### `of`

Type: CSF file exports

Specifies which meta's title is displayed.
