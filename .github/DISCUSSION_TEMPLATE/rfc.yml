      description: |
        Describe alternative approaches that have been considered and why they have been dropped.

        As we discuss this project, it is common for some ideas to be abandoned. Instead of deleting them, let's document the rationale. This way, when people review this proposal in the future, they can avoid the same thinking path and pitfalls we have already learned from.
