        ## To do

        Before merging the PR, there are a few QA steps to go through:

        - [ ] Add the \\"freeze\\" label to this PR, to ensure it doesn\\'t get automatically forced pushed by new changes.
        - [ ] Add the \\"ci:daily\\" label to this PR, to trigger the full test suite to run on this PR.

        And for each change below:

        1. Ensure the change is appropriate for the version bump. E.g. patch release should only contain patches, not new or de-stabilizing features. If a change is not appropriate, revert the PR.
        2. Ensure the PR is labeled correctly with one of: \\"BREAKING CHANGE\\", \\"feature request\\", \\"bug\\", \\"maintenance\\", \\"dependencies\\", \\"documentation\\", \\"build\\", \\"unknown\\".
        3. Ensure the PR title is correct, and follows the format \\"[Area]: [Summary]\\", e.g. *\\"React: Fix hooks in CSF3 render functions\\"*. If it is not correct, change the title in the PR.
            - Areas include: React, Vue, Core, Docs, Controls, etc.
            - First word of summary indicates the type: ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù, ‚ÄúFix‚Äù, ‚ÄúUpgrade‚Äù, etc.
            - The entire title should fit on a line

        This is a list of all the PRs merged and commits pushed directly to \\\`next\\\`, that will be part of this release:
