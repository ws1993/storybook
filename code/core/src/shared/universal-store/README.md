# Universal Store

The Universal Store API is used to manage state and events that should be synced across multiple environments, such as the server, the manager or the preview.

It is still highly experimental, and the API is subject to change - please don't use it.

For docs, see [UniversalStore's JSDocs](./index.ts). For usage examples and expected behavior, see [the tests](./index.test.ts)
