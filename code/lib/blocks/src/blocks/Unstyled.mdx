# The Unstyled Block

By default most elements in docs have a few default styles applied to ensure the docs look good. This is achieved by applying default styles to most elements like `h1`, `p`, etc..
However sometimes you might want some of your content to not have these styles applied, this is where the `Unstyled` block is useful. Wrap any content you want in the `Unstyled` block to remove the default styles:

```md
import { Unstyled } from '@storybook/blocks';

# This heading will be styled

<h2>So will this subheading</h2>

> This block quote will be styled

... and so will this paragraph.

<Unstyled>
  # This heading will not be styled

  <h2>Neither will this subheading</h2>

  > This block quote will not be styled

  ... neither will this paragraph, nor the following component:
  <MyCustomComponent />
</Unstyled>
```

Yields: 

# This heading will be styled

<h2>So will this subheading</h2>

> This block quote will be styled

... and so will this paragraph.

<Unstyled>
  # This heading will not be styled

  <h2>Neither will this subheading</h2>

  > This block quote will not be styled

  ... neither will this paragraph, nor the following component:
</Unstyled>
